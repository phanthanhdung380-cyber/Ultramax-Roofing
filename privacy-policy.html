                <p>Residents of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have similar rights to access, correct, delete, and obtain a copy of their personal information, as well as the right to opt out of targeted advertising and the sale of personal information.

                <h2>Exercising Your Rights</h2>
