                <p>Our website uses a limited number of cookies, categorized as follows:</p>

                <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are essential for the website to function properly. They enable basic navigation, access to secure areas, and ensure pages load correctly. Without these cookies, certain website features would not be available. Strictly necessary cookies do not collect information about you for marketing purposes and cannot be disabled through our cookie settings.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Session management cookies that maintain your connection as you navigate between pages.</p>

                <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
                <p>Functional cookies remember choices you make to provide enhanced, personalized features. These may include remembering your language preference, regional settings, or text size selections. The information collected by functional cookies is typically anonymized and does not track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies that remember if you have dismissed notification messages or accepted cookie consent.</p>

                <h3>Limited Analytics Cookies</h3>
